## E-commerce Analysis

This project was carried out on a dataset belonging to a fictitious e-commerce company that specialises in electronic products. The goal of this analysis was to observe sales trends, growth rates, marketing channels distribution, regional performance and the efficacy of the loyalty program. This was carried out in order to give recommendations on the continuation of the loyalty program.

## Summary of insights

**Yearly Sales Trends**: Between 2019 and 2022, average number of sales per year was 23.2K, with average yearly sale revenue of $6M and average order value of $253. 2021 saw the highest number of sales (30.7K), but the most expensive sales were observed in 2020 (AOV $298).

**Growth rates**: In 2020, sales surged, doubling total revenue from 2019 with a 31% higher AOV. However, in 2021, despite positive sales growth, total revenue declined due to 15% less expensive items being favored on average.

**Seasonality**: During winter (November and December), sales are typically higher due to holiday gift buying and seasonal promotions. In May 2020, the business achieved impressive milestones with the highest recorded sales of $883,406, the peak average order value (AOV) of Â£320 in October 2020, and 3065 orders in the same month. These stats serve as valuable benchmarks for future growth and performance evaluation. 

**Products**: Across all 4 years, Apple Airpods Headphones have been the best-selling product, with an average of 10K orders a year. Between 2019 and 2020, 85% of sales came from the top 3 products - the Apple headphones, the gaming monitor, and the Macbook Air Laptop.

**Loyalty Program**: During 2019 and 2020, loyalty program customers made fewer and less expensive purchases than non-loyalty customers. However, in 2021-2022, loyalty customers not only made more purchases but also spent about $30 more on average. Considering this recent trend, we recommend continuing the loyalty program.
