# E-commerce_analysis

This project was carried out on a dataset belonging to a fictitious e-commerce company that specialises in electronic products. The goal of this analysis was to observe sales trends, growth rates, marketing channels distribution, regional performance and the efficacy of the loyalty program. This was carried out in order to give recommendations on the continuation of the loyalty program.

I used Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyse, and summarise the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and product team.

# Summary of insights


**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the **average annual sales** reached **23K orders** with a **yearly revenue** of **$6 million** and an average order value of **$253**. Notably, **2021** had the **highest number of sales (30,700)**, while **2020** exhibited **the highest average order value ($298).**

**Seasonality:** Spring months tend to have higher sales, possibly due to promotions, and there was a **spike in average sale price** in January and February 2020, possibly related to pandemic purchases.

**Products:** Apple Airpods Headphones consistently ranked as the **best-selling product**, and between 2019 and 2022, the **top three products** accounted for **85% of sales**, while the Bose Headphones had the lowest number of sales across most years.

**Loyalty Program:** The team recommends **continuing with the loyalty program**, as these customers madee **more purchases in 2021 and 2022** than non-loyalty program customers and **spend an average of $30 more in 2022** per purchase even with their program discount.
